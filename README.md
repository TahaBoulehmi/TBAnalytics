### Tech

TBAnalytics uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React.js] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [React Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Node.js] - for creating the API
* [D3JS] - a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data
* [Atom Editor] - awesome web-based text editor that I used to develop the App

And of course TBAnalytics itself is open source with a [public repository][TBAnalytics]
 on GitHub.
